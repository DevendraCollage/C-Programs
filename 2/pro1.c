/* Algorithm
Step-1 : First of i will add the processor commands means header files (eg:#include<stdio.h>)
Step-2 : After that i will define the pie value in the define directives (eg:#define PI 3.14)
Step-3 : Then we have to define main function which is where program execution starts from (eg:main())
Step-4 : Then i will declare variables for radius,area
Step-5 : Now i will get the radius from the user to enter the radius of the circle
Step-6 : I will calculate the area by using formula(PI * r^2) (eg:are=PI*radius*radius)
Step-7 : After that i will print the area of circle using printf function.
