/* Algorithm
Step-1 : First of i will add the preprocessor commands means header files (eg:#include<stdio.h)
Step-2 : Then we have to define main function which is where program execution starts from (main())
Step-3 : Now we have to declare variables for height, base & Area(double).
Step-4 : After that i will get the height and base from the user.
Step-5 : And then calculate the area using formula given in problem statement. (area=height*base*0.5)
Step-6 : Finally print the result on screen by calling printf() function with appropriate parameters.
