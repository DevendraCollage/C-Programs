/* Algorithm
Step-1 : First i will add the preprocessor commands means that header files (eg:#include<stdio.h)
Step-2 : Then we have to define main function which is where program execution starts from (main())
Step-3 : Then we will declare the four variables to get the user input and calculate the simple interest (eg:p,n,r,simple_interest)
Step-4 : After we will get the user input using printf function (eg:P(Principle),N(Years),R(Interest Rate))
Step-5 : Now we need to calculate Simple Interest by multiply principle,years & rate(simple_interest=(p*n*r)/100)
Step-6 : After that we need to print simple interest using printf function
